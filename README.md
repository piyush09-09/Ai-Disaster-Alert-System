# AI-Powered Disaster Alert System

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end machine learning system that detects disasters like floods, wildfires, and earthquakes using **multimodal data**â€”satellite images, tweet texts, and metadata like location and time. It classifies, scores severity, and triggers alerts via a real-time dashboard.

## Goals
- Use BERT and CNN models for tweet/image classification
- Combine text + image data for improved accuracy
- Deploy a Streamlit dashboard for live alerts

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers
- OpenCV, Streamlit, SHAP (Explainable AI)
- Git, GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks
