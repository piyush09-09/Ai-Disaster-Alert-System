## Problem Statement

Natural disasters cause massive damage, and early detection is crucial. This project aims to build an AI system that automatically detects ongoing disasters using:
- Social media signals (text)
- Satellite images (vision)
- Time/location metadata

The system should classify disasters, estimate severity, and visualize alerts in real time.

## Objectives
1. Classify tweet text as disaster or not using NLP
2. Classify satellite images into disaster types
3. Combine predictions into a unified severity score
4. Display alerts with location, severity, and type
5. Deploy via a user-friendly web interface (Streamlit)
